# AssemblySelectionSort
Selection sort for random numbers from 100 - 999 in MASM

This program requires Irvine32.Inc library in order to simplify assembly language by providing easier for starting out
for a few function calls. The neccessary files can be found here:

This program will take in an input from the user for the amount of random numbers to generate
then will generate numbers between 100 and 999 and print them to the user, then it will sort them and
print them again in descending order along with a value for the median. The program will use the
system stack in order to pass parameters into methods in order to achieve this.
